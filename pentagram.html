                This is the design document for the game <em>Pentagram</em>, created during the Fall section of my Game Design and Development class, as our first Sprint. We wanted to make a game where the players had to team up with other players to win, in order to defeat the rest of the players. We were remarkably successful in this, creating a game that can be played through in around 10 minutes, and is incredibly fun to play. My primary responsibility on this project was in balancing the cards, and the characters, who each have their own specific deck of cards. It was very interesting to make each character be unique and powerful, while not allowing their deck to be too overpowered. The rules for the game can be found above.
