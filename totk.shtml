                The first game made by the ThunderForge Dev Team, which was begun at a weekend Hackathon in October of 2013. My responsibilities were for the story of the game, as well as to design the levels. In addition, I recorded the sound effects for the game. We created the game in construct 2, and the levels were all scripted in XML.
