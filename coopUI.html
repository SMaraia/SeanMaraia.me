				During the Summer of 2015, I worked at the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory in Cambridge, MA. While there, I worked primarily on a project that focused on determining the best ways to present information to soldiers and other first responders while they are in the field, improving their situational awareness without overloading the operator with too much information, or obscuring their vision. To that end, I created two prototype simulations demonstrating UI elements and methods to present a user with information about their 3D space overlaid onto their vision. The first prototype was created in Unreal Engine 4, and was run on an Oculus Rift DK2. This prototype was designed as a proof of concept and was a rough outline for what I would include in the second prototype, which was built in Unity for presentation on an Atheer Air Head Mounted Augmented Reality device. I created several different UI elements for these projects, such as a minimap that showed the user a top down view of their immediate area, which could be faded in and out based on the angle the user held their head, allowing the user to use the map without using their hands. In addition I created a compass bar, in the style of the <em>Batman: Arkham</em> series of games or <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>. This allowed the user to maintain a sense of their direction at all times without holding a compass, and also presented key landmarks to the user without having to look at the map. In addition, I experimented with creating 3D UI elements, such as an arrow that would point in the direction of the users primary point of interest, a waypoint system that changed the color of the ground, creating a path the user can follow to their objective, and other interesting elements.
